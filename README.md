# Prime-Number-Generator-Server
Previously, I have use JavaScript to generate small prime numbers online, the JS code will be run in client-side using whatever browser and the speed will be depending on the user machine spec.  This article will using python code to generate small prime number list, because python can not be executed in client-side inside browser like JavaScript, so I have to deploy it to a server and  which has a free hosting for python, I have have deployed it and to see the working action please see Python small prime numbers generators, I found this free python server's speed is much slower compare to my own local machine, but for a free service it is good enough to make a working prototype or just for sharing python app to others.  I have compared the speed using the JavaScript engine and the python, the implementation logic is quite similar, in my own testing to generate all small prime number under 1 million, the JavaScript running in Chrome browser takes 0.046 seconds and the python3 (in command line) implementation takes 0.55 seconds, it is strange to see the JavaScript is so much faster even though it runs on Chrome.
